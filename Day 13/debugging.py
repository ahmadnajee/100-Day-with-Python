# 1 - What is the for loop doing?
# it is going to loop through the numbers between 1 to 20, and if the number equal to 20 it will print the message.

# 2 - when the function meant to print ( "You got it ") ?
# when ever the i is equal to 20

# 3- what are assumption about the value of i? 
# it will be between 1 to 20 not include  20
